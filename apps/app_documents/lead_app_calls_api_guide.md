# Lead App — Calls API Guide

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8188`

## Endpoints

All CRUD endpoints are nested under a specific lead. A flat cross-lead call log is also available.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Access |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| GET | `/api/calls/` | **All calls across leads** (paginated, newest first) | Authenticated |
| GET | `/api/calls/summary/` | **Call totals**, calls per day and top callers for the current filters | Authenticated |
| GET | `/api/calls/export/` | **CSV download** of every call matching the current filters | Authenticated |
| GET | `/api/leads/{lead_id}/calls/` | List calls for one lead (paginated) | Authenticated |
| POST | `/api/leads/{lead_id}/calls/` | Add a call (consumes call minutes) | Staff or `lead.add_leadcall` permission |
| GET | `/api/leads/{lead_id}/calls/{id}/` | Get call detail | Authenticated |
| PATCH | `/api/leads/{lead_id}/calls/{id}/` | Update call notes/outcome etc. | Staff or `lead.change_leadcall` permission |

> **DELETE is disabled** — call records are permanent and cannot be deleted via the API (`405 Method Not Allowed`), so the call-minutes ledger stays trustworthy.

## Global Call Log — `GET /api/calls/`

Read-only list of every call across all leads, **branch-scoped** (staff see all / `?branch_id=X`; non-staff locked to their branch). Ordered by `call_timestamp` descending by default.

**Query params:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `direction` | `inbound` or `outbound` |
| `created_by` | User ID — calls logged by that user |
| `student` | Student ID — calls on the lead linked to that student |
| `lead` | Lead ID |
| `call_timestamp__gte` / `__lte` | Date/time range (ISO 8601) |
| `search` | Matches caller, phone number, outcome, notes, lead name & reference number |
| `ordering` | `call_timestamp`, `duration_seconds`, `created_at` (prefix `-` for desc) |
| `page` / `page_size` | Standard pagination |

**Example response row:**
```json
{
    "id": 24,
    "lead": 101,
    "lead_name": "Sita Kumari InvoiceTest",
    "lead_reference_number": "LD-2026-000086",
    "call_timestamp": "2026-08-26T05:48:13Z",
    "direction": "outbound",
    "caller": "Shikhar",
    "phone_number": "9877700111",
    "duration_seconds": 270,
    "duration_formatted": "04:30",
    "outcome": "Interested",
    "notes": "",
    "branch": 1,
    "created_by": 9,
    "created_by_name": "Shikhar"
}
```

The `lead` field is auto-set from the URL. `created_by` is auto-set to the requesting user.

## Call Summary — `GET /api/calls/summary/`

Totals for the call log, built for the Calls page header cards and charts. It takes **the same filters, `search` and branch scoping as `GET /api/calls/`** (staff see all / `?branch_id=X`; non-staff locked to their branch), so for the same query string `total_calls` equals the list's `count`. `page`, `page_size` and `ordering` are ignored. The response is one unpaginated object and costs a fixed three database queries however many calls match.

**Example response:**
```json
{
    "total_calls": 128,
    "inbound": 40,
    "outbound": 88,
    "total_seconds": 30215,
    "total_formatted": "08:23:35",
    "avg_seconds": 236,
    "connected_calls": 110,
    "connect_rate": 0.859,
    "by_day": [{ "date": "2026-10-28", "calls": 14, "seconds": 3310 }],
    "by_user": [{ "user_id": 9, "name": "Shikhar", "calls": 40, "seconds": 9800 }]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `total_calls` / `inbound` / `outbound` | Number of matching calls and the split by direction |
| `total_seconds` / `total_formatted` | Talk time in seconds and as `HH:MM:SS` |
| `avg_seconds` | Average duration in whole seconds (`0` when there are no calls) |
| `connected_calls` | Calls that lasted more than 0 seconds |
| `connect_rate` | `connected_calls / total_calls`, between `0` and `1`, rounded to 3 decimals (`0` when there are no calls) |
| `by_day` | Calls and seconds per day, oldest first. **Days are counted in Nepal time (`Asia/Kathmandu`)**: a call at 20:00 UTC on Oct 28 is counted under `2026-10-29` |
| `by_user` | The 10 callers with the most calls (ties broken by talk time). Calls with no `created_by` appear as `user_id: null`, `name: "Unknown"` |

With no matching calls every number is `0` and `by_day` and `by_user` are empty lists.

## Call Export — `GET /api/calls/export/`

Downloads every call matching the current filters as a CSV, **across all pages**. It takes the same filters, `search`, `ordering` and branch scoping as `GET /api/calls/`; `page` and `page_size` are ignored. Rows are newest first unless `ordering` says otherwise. The file is streamed, and the number of database queries does not grow with the number of rows.

**Response headers:** `Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8` and `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="calls-YYYY-MM-DD.csv"` (the date is today in Nepal time).

**Columns, in this order:**

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| `Date & time (NPT)` | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` in Nepal time |
| `Direction` | `Inbound` or `Outbound` |
| `Lead` | Lead name |
| `Reference` | Lead reference number, e.g. `LD-2026-000086` |
| `Phone` | Phone number |
| `Caller` | Caller name as stored on the call |
| `Logged by` | Name of the user who logged the call (empty if none) |
| `Duration (MM:SS)` | e.g. `04:19` |
| `Seconds` | Duration in seconds |
| `Outcome` | Call outcome |
| `Notes` | Call notes |
| `Recording` | Recording URL |

**Spreadsheet behaviour:**

- The file starts with a UTF-8 byte order mark so Excel shows Nepali (Devanagari) text correctly.
- **Formula safety:** any text cell that starts with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` (or a tab or carriage return) gets a leading `'`, so a note such as `=HYPERLINK(...)` is shown as plain text and never runs. The one exception is a phone number written in plain international form such as `+9779812345678`, which is left as it is.

**Calling it from the frontend:** fetch it with axios and `responseType: "blob"`, then save it with an object URL. A plain link skips the login-cookie refresh in `src/lib/api.ts`.

## Call Minutes Deduction

Creating a call **deducts minutes from the requesting user's balance**:

- Minutes charged = the call's **exact `duration_seconds`** (no rounding). A 4m30s (270s) call deducts exactly 270 seconds; a 0-second call is recorded but deducts nothing.
- If the balance is lower than the required minutes, the call is **rejected** with:
  ```json
  { "detail": "Insufficient call minutes (required 270 seconds, available 120 seconds)." }
  ```
- On success, the response includes: `seconds_used`, `remaining_seconds`, plus floored `minutes_used` / `remaining_minutes` for convenience.
- Every deduction writes a row in the immutable ledger in **seconds** (see [Call Minutes](account_app_apis_guide.md#call-minutes)).
- `duration_seconds` and `caller` are **locked after creation** — PATCH requests silently ignore changes to them.

### Flexible duration input (`duration_input`)

Send `duration_input` instead of `duration_seconds` — the backend parses these formats into seconds:

| Input | Meaning | Stored |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `"4:19"` | 4 min 19 sec | `259` |
| `"4.19"` | 4 min 19 sec (dot = MM.SS) | `259` |
| `"04:19"` | 4 min 19 sec (leading zero) | `259` |
| `"4m19s"` | 4 min 19 sec (suffix) | `259` |
| `"1:02:30"` | 1 hr 2 min 30 sec | `3750` |
| `"259"` | raw seconds | `259` |
| `"4.5"` | 4 min **05** sec (single digit = seconds, zero-padded) | `245` |
| `"7.89"` | **carries**: 7 min 89 sec → 8 min 29 sec | `509` |
| `"7:89"` | carries: 8 min 29 sec | `509` |

> **Overflow carry:** any seconds/minutes part ≥ 60 automatically rolls up (stopwatch style) — `7.89` → 8:29, `1:99:99` → 2:40:39.

**Request:**
```json
{
    "call_timestamp": "2026-08-26T05:48:00Z",
    "caller": "Counselor",
    "phone_number": "9800000001",
    "duration_input": "4:19",
    "outcome": "Interested"
}
```
Invalid formats return `400 {"duration_input": ["Invalid duration format: …"]}`. The plain integer `duration_seconds` field is still accepted unchanged.

### Formatted duration in responses

Every call response includes `duration_formatted` (`"MM:SS"`, e.g. `"04:19"`) for display.

**Example POST response (201):**
```json
{
    "id": 21,
    "duration_seconds": 259,
    "duration_formatted": "04:19",
    "seconds_used": 259,
    "remaining_seconds": 330,
    "minutes_used": 4,
    "remaining_minutes": 5,
    "...": "…other standard fields…"
}
```
