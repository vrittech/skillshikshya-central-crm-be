# Lead App — Calls API Guide

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8188`

## Endpoints

All CRUD endpoints are nested under a specific lead. A flat cross-lead call log is also available.

| Method | Endpoint                           | Description                                          | Access                                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/api/calls/`                      | **All calls across leads** (paginated, newest first) | Authenticated                              |
| GET    | `/api/calls/summary/`              | Filtered totals, daily call counts and top callers   | Authenticated                              |
| GET    | `/api/calls/export/`               | Filtered CSV export across all pages                 | Authenticated                              |
| GET    | `/api/leads/{lead_id}/calls/`      | List calls for one lead (paginated)                  | Authenticated                              |
| POST   | `/api/leads/{lead_id}/calls/`      | Add a call (consumes call minutes)                   | Staff or `lead.add_leadcall` permission    |
| GET    | `/api/leads/{lead_id}/calls/{id}/` | Get call detail                                      | Authenticated                              |
| PATCH  | `/api/leads/{lead_id}/calls/{id}/` | Update call notes/outcome etc.                       | Staff or `lead.change_leadcall` permission |

> **DELETE is disabled** — call records are permanent and cannot be deleted via the API (`405 Method Not Allowed`), so the call-minutes ledger stays trustworthy.

## Global Call Log — `GET /api/calls/`

Read-only list of every call across all leads, **branch-scoped** (staff see all / `?branch_id=X`; non-staff locked to their branch). Ordered by `call_timestamp` descending by default.

**Query params:**

| Parameter                       | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `direction`                     | `inbound` or `outbound`                                                    |
| `created_by`                    | User ID — calls logged by that user                                        |
| `student`                       | Student ID — calls on the lead linked to that student                      |
| `lead`                          | Lead ID                                                                    |
| `call_timestamp__gte` / `__lte` | Date/time range (ISO 8601)                                                 |
| `search`                        | Matches caller, phone number, outcome, notes, lead name & reference number |
| `ordering`                      | `call_timestamp`, `duration_seconds`, `created_at` (prefix `-` for desc)   |
| `page` / `page_size`            | Standard pagination                                                        |

**Example response row:**

```json
{
  "id": 24,
  "lead": 101,
  "lead_name": "Sita Kumari InvoiceTest",
  "lead_reference_number": "LD-2026-000086",
  "call_timestamp": "2026-08-26T05:48:13Z",
  "direction": "outbound",
  "caller": "Shikhar",
  "phone_number": "9877700111",
  "duration_seconds": 270,
  "outcome": "Interested",
  "notes": "",
  "branch": 1,
  "created_by": 9,
  "created_by_name": "Shikhar"
}
```

### Calls summary — `GET /api/calls/summary/`

Accepts the same filters as the global call list. The response includes
`total_calls`, inbound/outbound counts, total and average duration in seconds,
`connect_rate` (calls longer than zero seconds), `calls_per_day` grouped in
Nepal time, and the top 10 callers.

### Calls export — `GET /api/calls/export/`

Accepts the same filters as the global call list and returns a UTF-8 CSV with a
byte-order mark for spreadsheet compatibility. The export is not paginated and
uses the columns: Date & time (NPT), Direction, Lead, Reference, Phone, Caller,
Logged by, Duration (MM:SS), Seconds, Outcome, Notes and Recording. Notes that
begin with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` are prefixed with an apostrophe to prevent
spreadsheet formula execution.

The `lead` field is auto-set from the URL. `created_by` is auto-set to the requesting user.

## Call Minutes Deduction

Creating a call **deducts minutes from the requesting user's balance**:

- Minutes charged = the call's **exact `duration_seconds`** (no rounding). A 4m30s (270s) call deducts exactly 270 seconds; a 0-second call is recorded but deducts nothing.
- If the balance is lower than the required minutes, the call is **rejected** with:
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Insufficient call minutes (required 270 seconds, available 120 seconds)."
  }
  ```
- On success, the response includes: `seconds_used`, `remaining_seconds`, plus floored `minutes_used` / `remaining_minutes` for convenience.
- Every deduction writes a row in the immutable ledger in **seconds** (see [Call Minutes](account_app_apis_guide.md#call-minutes)).
- `duration_seconds` and `caller` are **locked after creation** — PATCH requests silently ignore changes to them.

### Flexible duration input (`duration_input`)

Send `duration_input` instead of `duration_seconds` — the backend parses these formats into seconds:

| Input       | Meaning                                                | Stored |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| `"4:19"`    | 4 min 19 sec                                           | `259`  |
| `"4.19"`    | 4 min 19 sec (dot = MM.SS)                             | `259`  |
| `"04:19"`   | 4 min 19 sec (leading zero)                            | `259`  |
| `"4m19s"`   | 4 min 19 sec (suffix)                                  | `259`  |
| `"1:02:30"` | 1 hr 2 min 30 sec                                      | `3750` |
| `"259"`     | raw seconds                                            | `259`  |
| `"4.5"`     | 4 min **05** sec (single digit = seconds, zero-padded) | `245`  |
| `"7.89"`    | **carries**: 7 min 89 sec → 8 min 29 sec               | `509`  |
| `"7:89"`    | carries: 8 min 29 sec                                  | `509`  |

> **Overflow carry:** any seconds/minutes part ≥ 60 automatically rolls up (stopwatch style) — `7.89` → 8:29, `1:99:99` → 2:40:39.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "call_timestamp": "2026-08-26T05:48:00Z",
  "caller": "Counselor",
  "phone_number": "9800000001",
  "duration_input": "4:19",
  "outcome": "Interested"
}
```

Invalid formats return `400 {"duration_input": ["Invalid duration format: …"]}`. The plain integer `duration_seconds` field is still accepted unchanged.

### Formatted duration in responses

Every call response includes `duration_formatted` (`"MM:SS"`, e.g. `"04:19"`) for display.

**Example POST response (201):**

```json
{
  "id": 21,
  "duration_seconds": 259,
  "duration_formatted": "04:19",
  "seconds_used": 259,
  "remaining_seconds": 330,
  "minutes_used": 4,
  "remaining_minutes": 5,
  "...": "…other standard fields…"
}
```

### Auto-updates on Lead

When a call is created, the parent lead is automatically updated:

| Lead field        | Effect                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `last_contact_at` | Set to `call_timestamp` if newer than existing value |
| `lead_score`      | Recalculated (engagement factor)                     |
